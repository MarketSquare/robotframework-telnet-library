Telnet library tests
====================

To run the Telnet library acceptance tests you will need to have a telnet
server running at localhost and accepting login from user ``test`` with password
``test``. Needless to say, you probably dont want this server to be visible to
public internet.

The user ``test`` is also assumed to have home directory at ``/home/test`` and prompt
set at ``PS1='\u@\h \W \$ '``
